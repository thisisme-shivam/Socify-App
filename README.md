## **What is Socify?**

-> Socify is an android application / social media platform which provides space for college students to bridge the gap of interaction among individuals and make it easy to share their thoughts, ask their questions and join communities and groups as per their interests. Socify also provides an environment where the interaction between different minds benefits the institute as whole.

## **How is Socify different?**

-> Socify is different from other social media platform because it solves the interactivity problem among students from different semesters, different branches and different interests. With the help of Socify, solutions for problems like FAQs of students, answers, thoughts and ideas of students can be shared easily. Each individual mind can help contribute to help others with Socify which, in turn will bring forth new ideas, questions and solutions to them. This in turn, will result in the overall development of the students of an institute.
